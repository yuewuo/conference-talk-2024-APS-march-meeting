First start a local server. Note that opening `index.html` file directly doesn't work because of CORS policy.

```sh
python3 server.py
```

Open the browser and visit [http://localhost:8099/index.html?animation=debug_demo](http://localhost:8099/index.html?animation=debug_demo).

All the files under the root directory cal be loaded as an animation.
